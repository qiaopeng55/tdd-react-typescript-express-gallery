# Simple React Gallery with Express backend

## Overview

A React.js Redux based simple product gallery that features json-server based Express backend.

The project was developed to demonstrate best practice in Test Driven TypeScript full stack development.

## Getting started

- clone the repository
- `yarn install` to install all dependencies
- `yarn start` to start both the client & server (this project uses ejected create-react-app with json-server based Express backend)

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.

### `yarn test-coverage`

Generate test coverage report

## Whatâ€™s Included?

- React, Redux and react-router 4
- styled-components
- TypeScript
- custom tslint & tsconfig rules
- testing using [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest)

Note: the backend was mostly build leveraging json-server as the main focus of the app is on front end.

### Featured Technologies

- react, redux & redux-router. These tools work great together to help structure unidirectional data flow
- enzyme & jest. I always believe testing is as important as production code and I have tried my best to achieve high test coverage in my code (currently at 91.45% for the code base)
- create react app, good default configuration to help bootstrap the react app
- tslint & tsconfig, when used with editor integration these tools will offer great assistance in enforcing coding standard and catch potential errors
- TypeScript - allow developers to code against clear interface and contract, and help developer dealing with growing teams and features as the code base grow.
